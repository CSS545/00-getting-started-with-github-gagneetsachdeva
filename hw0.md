1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS)
I intend to work on Android platform as a part of my final project. Having used mobile devices running on multiple platforms(Android, iOS, Tizen) , Android is one of my favourite. 
2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift)
My intended programming language for Android App development will be Java as I am more familiar with it compared to Kotlin and it will help me achieve my project goals in this limited timeframe
3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development
Yes, I would like to explore cross-platform development as it will help me create an app that can be  run on multiple platforms making it accessible to wider audience.
